<p>Remember when I used to climb in Pittsburgh?</p>
<br/>
<p>I remember taking the 75 to Ascend Southside. That gym was awesome.</p>
<p>Getting off at the intersection where the tattoo with the letter 'K' made of bright yellow circle lights.</p>
<p>Taking a left onto 21st street, then another left onto Mary street and pass by a crossfit gym, into parking lot, go up 2 flights of stairs yuuuuppp.</p>
<p>There was the awesome cave section that formed an arch, and then a top rope section, a really nice slab wall to the left of the entrance, and an island across it.</p>
<p>I remember one day it was like 10pm, and  I was waiting for the bus back from Southside and I'm pretty sure I saw someone very special drive past me, and we saw each other...</p>
<p></p>
<p>Two times I climbed with the TA staff, and then we'd get food after.</p>
<p>Sometime's I'd climb at Point Breeze, and that would be with the Master's students or with Nate!</p>
<p>What comes to mind right now is being in Nate's Hatsune Miku hacked car and playing super bass heavy music.</p>
<p>I feel like I've brought back a little spark just by writing this.</p>
