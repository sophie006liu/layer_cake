<p>I drove to one coffee shop, could not find parking. Found parking.</p>
<p>At that point I was 11 minutes away by foot from the coffee shop.</p>
<p>Went to a different coffee shop instead.</p>
<p>Should have walked instead.</p>
<p>It will all be ok...</p>

<p>Easy(?) way for Seattle to be a better city. Better traffic lights.</p>
<p>We should be having sensors for traffic, not timers that hold a green light even when there's no cars.</p>
<br/>
<p>We have LLMs. How come we haven't integrated it into maps. Like instead of being confused at a light,</p>
<p>there be the capapbility to say something like, "Hey Google, is this my turn?". "What direction should I turn?"</p>
<p>That would save the driver the need to turn and look the screen, which sounds lazy, but is more safe because their 
    eyes on the road.</p>

<p>I need to have a list of websites/internet places where I can consueme with no ads.</p>
<p>I know companies need ads to make revenue, but the current state of ads is definitely excessive.</p>
<p>I just want to read the news, and I can't read it without 4 ads, each one messing with the text formatting.</p>
<p>They almost feel like an invasion of privacy</p>
<p>I guess I just just watch less youtube...yeah I think I'll just do that</p>
