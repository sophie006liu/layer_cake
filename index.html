<p>Celebrated a very cozy Thanksgiving by playing Clue and Collaborative Poker with my family and friends.</p>
<p>Someone pointed out to me that I seem more jaded than usual. They haven't seen me in months.</p>
<p>我不感觉我的朋友说是错的。</p>
<p>C'est vrai que dans les moins passés, mon moral a faiblit.</p>
<p>Mais je pense que c'est le même schéma qu'avant.</p>
<p>全都真的是在我的心态里。</p>
<p>Sto molto bene! Sarò meno triste, più felice e sarò forte</p>
<p>毕竟， 我能瘦四种语言。看我的！</p>
<p>Je suis joyeux maintenant, et je me souviens de tous mes professeurs et amis qui m'ont soutenu.</p>
<p>I can't let them down, and most importantly I can't let myself down!</p>
<p>Ho ragione e sono molto molto forte. </p>
<p>Cette phrase n'est pas difficile à comprendre.</p>
<p>所以你别太骄傲了。</p>
<br/>
    
<p>I don't think my friend is wrong. I'm not sad, but I'm not exhilerated.</p>
<p>I still feel pretty awesome!</p>
<p>I'm not jaded! I'm still awesome and I'm cool (and I'm not coping)!</p>
<p>I'm just trying my best... and me right now is a result of that...</p>
<br/>

<p>I feel so eensy tiny like a mouse. And it feels awesome.</p>
<p>I feel awesome.</p>
<p>I hope my friends feel awesome &gt;:)</p>

<p>What purpose does money serve?</p>
<p>When someone is in human civilization, plopped in the middle of Seattle, they would need money to acquire a sufficient amount of food, water, medicine, and shelter. Their necessities.</p>
<p>Money is a signifier that they work and have earned my food, water, medicine, and shelter. Their necessities.</p>
<p>Sounds good to me!</p>

<p>I need a Girl's Generation release. I think many people would be happier for sometime if Girl's Generation released a new song.</p>
<p>Speaking into existence right now :).</p>

<p>It would be nice to have an app or spotify plugin so that when I listen to a podcast, it will pre-process the audio and then cut out the ad sections >:).</p>

<p>Displacing people intensified the lack of independent land rights for women and general female autonomy in 3 case studies</p>
<p>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03066150.2017.1367291</p>
<p>The increased value of land and its commercialization is also closely linked to violence.</p>
<p>https://doi.org/10.1177/000203971705200102</p>
<p>War is a driver of gender inequality because the pursuit of land using violent means perpetuates the oppression of women in private settinga and the perception of women in society.</p>

<p>Tell me the world gets better than this!</p>

<p>I drove to one coffee shop, could not find parking. Found parking.</p>
<p>At that point I was 11 minutes away by foot from the coffee shop.</p>
<p>Went to a different coffee shop instead.</p>
<p>Should have walked instead.</p>
<p>It will all be ok...</p>

<p>Easy(?) way for Seattle to be a better city. Better traffic lights.</p>
<p>We should be having sensors for traffic, not timers that hold a green light even when there's no cars.</p>
<br/>
<p>We have LLMs. How come we haven't integrated it into maps. Like instead of being confused at a light,</p>
<p>there be the capapbility to say something like, "Hey Google, is this my turn?". "What direction should I turn?"</p>
<p>That would save the driver the need to turn and look the screen, which sounds lazy, but is more safe because their 
    eyes on the road.</p>

<p>I need to have a list of websites/internet places where I can consueme with no ads.</p>
<p>I know companies need ads to make revenue, but the current state of ads is definitely excessive.</p>
<p>I just want to read the news, and I can't read it without 4 ads, each one messing with the text formatting.</p>
<p>They almost feel like an invasion of privacy</p>
<p>I guess I just just watch less youtube...yeah I think I'll just do that</p>
