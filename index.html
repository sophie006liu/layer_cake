<p>I need to have a list of websites/internet places where I can consueme with no ads.</p>
<p>I know companies need ads to make revenue, but the current state of ads is definitely excessive.</p>
<p>I just want to read the news, and I can't read it without 4 ads, each one messing with the text formatting.</p>
<p>They almost feel like an invasion of privacy</p>
<p>I guess I just just watch less youtube...yeah I think I'll just do that</p>
